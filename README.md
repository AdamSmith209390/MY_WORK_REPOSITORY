## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

### Development Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python 3.x, Flask Framework
- **Styling:** Modern CSS with gradients, animations, and responsive design
- **API:** RESTful endpoints with JSON responses

### Development Tools
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Repository Hosting:** GitHub
- **Development Environment:** Windows PowerShell
- **Code Editor:** Various text editors/IDEs

## 🔄 Git Workflow Practiced

### Professional Development Patterns
1. **Repository Initialization**
   - Local Git repository setup
   - Remote GitHub repository connection
   - Initial commit with complete codebase

2. **Feature Branch Workflow**
   - Created feature branches: `feature/enhance-frontend-ui`
   - Implemented changes in isolation from main branch
   - Professional commit messaging with conventional commits

3. **Collaboration Practices**
   - Pull Request creation and management
   - Code review simulation
   - Branch merging strategies
   - Remote repository synchronization

### Commands Mastered
```bash
# Repository Setup
git init
git remote add origin <url>
git push -u origin main

# Feature Development
git checkout -b feature/branch-name
git add .
git commit -m "feat: descriptive message"
git push -u origin feature/branch-name

# Repository Management
git status
git log --oneline
git branch
```

## 🌟 Key Features Implemented

### Frontend Capabilities
- **Interactive UI:** Dynamic button interactions with real-time feedback
- **Modern Design:** Gradient backgrounds, hover effects, and clean typography
- **Responsive Layout:** Mobile-friendly design patterns
- **API Simulation:** Mock backend data display and interaction

### Backend Architecture
- **REST API:** Multiple endpoints for data retrieval and health checks
- **Configuration Management:** Environment-based settings
- **Error Handling:** Robust response patterns
- **Development Server:** Local development environment setup

*This repository demonstrates practical application of professional software development practices including version control, collaborative workflows, and full-stack application architecture.*


Step 1: Test the Frontend First
powershell# Navigate to the frontend folder
cd K:\AU_GIT_REPOSITORY\MY_WORK_REPOSITORY\Project_001_Full_Stack_App\frontend

# Open the HTML file in your browser
start index.html
This should open your web page in your default browser. You should see:

A purple gradient background
White container with your app
"Click Me!" button
"Get Backend Data" button (if you're on the feature branch)

Try clicking the buttons and see what happens!
Step 2: Test the Backend
Open a new PowerShell window (keep the first one open) and run:
powershell# Navigate to backend folder
cd K:\AU_GIT_REPOSITORY\MY_WORK_REPOSITORY\Project_001_Full_Stack_App\backend

# First, let's see if you have Flask installed
pip list | findstr Flask

# If Flask isn't installed, install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Flask server
python app.py
The backend should start and show something like:
Starting Flask backend server...
* Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
* Running on http://192.168.x.x:5000
Step 3: Test the API
In your browser, go to:

http://localhost:5000 - Should show a JSON welcome message
http://localhost:5000/api/data - Should show sample data
http://localhost:5000/api/health - Should show health status
